Object - orientation aspects of java

Encapsulation :-
The ability to make changes in your implementation code without breaking the code of others who use your code is a key benefit of encapsulation.

  1)Keep instance variables protected.
  2)Make public accessor methods and force calling code to use those methods rather than directly accessing the instance variable.
  For the methods ,use the JavaBeans naming convention of set<someProperty> and get<someProperty>.
